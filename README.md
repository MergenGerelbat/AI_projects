All the codes in this directory are written by Mergenbaatar Gerelbat, for Artificial Intelligence, CS 440 taught at UIUC Fall 2017. They are only for personal use and potential employer view. If these codes were used by other people without my permission, I would take no responsibility of any potential outcomes (like violating academic integrity of UIUC). -Mergenbaatar Gerelbat
